# Setback Card Game

A multiplayer Setback card game built with **Phaser 3**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**. This project implements the traditional 4-player partnership card game with modern web technologies, comprehensive testing, and AI opponents.

## 🎮 About Setback

Setback is a classic American trick-taking card game played with partnerships. Players bid on how many points they can score, with trump suits determined during play. The game features complex scoring with six categories: High, Low, Jack, Off-Jack, Joker, and Game points.

**Key Features:**

- 4-player partnership gameplay (North/South vs East/West)
- Bidding system with 2-6 point bids
- Dynamic trump suit determination
- Complex scoring with 6 categories
- AI opponents with strategic decision-making
- Modern web interface with responsive design

## 🎯 Scoring System

The Setback scoring system is one of the most complex aspects of the game, implementing all 6 traditional scoring categories with proper trump hierarchy and bidding integration.

### 6 Scoring Categories

Each hand awards up to **6 points** across these categories:

#### 1. **High Trump (1 point)**

- **Awarded to**: Player who captures the highest trump card in tricks
- **Trump Hierarchy**: Joker > Jack of Trump > Off-Jack > Ace > King > Queen > ... > 2
- **Implementation**: `findHighestTrump()` searches all played trump cards using `Card.compareForTrump()`

#### 2. **Low Trump (1 point)**

- **Awarded to**: Player who captures the lowest trump card in tricks
- **Logic**: Finds minimum trump card taken, not just dealt
- **Note**: Must be captured in a trick to count

#### 3. **Jack of Trump (1 point)**

- **Awarded to**: Player who captures the Jack of the trump suit
- **Condition**: `card.suit === trumpSuit && card.rank === 11`
- **Special Case**: If Jack of trump not dealt, no point awarded

#### 4. **Off-Jack (1 point)**

- **Awarded to**: Player who captures the Jack of the same color as trump
- **Color Logic**:
  - **Red Suits**: Hearts ↔ Diamonds
  - **Black Suits**: Clubs ↔ Spades
- **Example**: If trump is Hearts, Off-Jack is Jack of Diamonds

#### 5. **Joker (1 point)**

- **Awarded to**: Player who captures the Joker
- **Trump Status**: Joker is always the highest trump card
- **Note**: If Joker not dealt, no point awarded

#### 6. **Game Points (1 point)**

- **Awarded to**: Partnership with majority of "small points"
- **Small Points Values**:
  - **Ten**: 10 points
  - **Ace**: 4 points
  - **King**: 3 points
  - **Queen**: 2 points
  - **Jack**: 1 point
  - **All others**: 0 points
- **Total Available**: 30 small points per deal (4×10 + 4×4 + 4×3 + 4×2 + 4×1)

### Bidding Integration

The scoring system integrates tightly with bidding to determine final partnership scores:

#### Bidding Partnership

- **Bid Made** (earned points ≥ bid): Score += bid amount
- **Bid Failed** (earned points < bid): Score -= bid amount *(can go negative)*

#### Non-Bidding Partnership

- **Always**: Score += actual points earned
- **No Risk**: Never penalized for other team's failed bid

### Special Rules & Edge Cases

#### Trump Card Hierarchy

```text
Joker (trump value = 4)     ← Always highest trump
Jack of Trump (trump value = 3)
Off-Jack (trump value = 2)
Regular Trump Cards (trump value = 1) ← Ranked Ace high to 2 low
```

#### Game Points Tie-Breaking

- If partnerships tie on small points, **bidding partnership wins**
- Ensures no ties in the Game category

#### Missing Cards

- If Jack of trump not dealt → No Jack point awarded
- If Off-Jack not dealt → No Off-Jack point awarded
- If Joker not dealt → No Joker point awarded
- System gracefully handles null values

### Implementation Architecture

#### Core Data Structures

```typescript
interface HandScoreResult {
  points: {
    high: { winner: string; card: Card } | null;
    low: { winner: string; card: Card } | null;
    jack: { winner: string; card: Card } | null;
    offJack: { winner: string; card: Card } | null;
    joker: { winner: string; card: Card } | null;
    game: { winner: string; smallPoints: number } | null;
  };
  bidMade: boolean;
  biddingPartnership: string;
  biddingPartnershipPoints: number;
  nonBiddingPartnershipPoints: number;
}
```

#### Key Methods

- **`scoreHand()`**: Main scoring orchestrator in GameManager
- **`findHighestTrump()`**: High trump calculation
- **`findLowestTrump()`**: Low trump calculation
- **`calculateGamePoints()`**: Small points summation
- **`Card.pointValue`**: Individual card point values
- **`Card.compareForTrump()`**: Trump hierarchy comparison

### Performance & Testing

- **99.15% Test Coverage**: Comprehensive scoring scenarios tested
- **Performance**: Hand scoring completes <50ms
- **Integration**: Full event system for UI updates
- **Error Handling**: Validates trump suits, bids, and partnerships

### Example Scoring Scenario

**Trump Suit**: Hearts
**Bidding Team**: North/South (bid 4 points)
**Points Earned**:

- High: Joker captured by North → North/South gets 1 point
- Low: 2 of Hearts captured by East → East/West gets 1 point
- Jack: Jack of Hearts captured by South → North/South gets 1 point
- Off-Jack: Jack of Diamonds captured by West → East/West gets 1 point
- Joker: Captured by North → North/South gets 1 point
- Game: North/South captured 16 small points, East/West captured 14 → North/South gets 1 point

**Final Result**:

- North/South earned 5 points (≥ 4 bid) → **Bid Made** → +4 to partnership score
- East/West earned 2 points → +2 to partnership score

This scoring system faithfully implements traditional Setback rules while providing the robust foundation needed for competitive digital gameplay.

## 🎨 Assets & Credits

### Card Sprites

High-quality playing card graphics are sourced from **[Tek Eye](https://tekeye.uk/playing_cards/svg-playing-cards)** - a collection of public domain SVG playing cards. These vector-based cards provide crisp, scalable graphics perfect for web games.

**Setup Process:**

1. Downloaded SVG card files from Tek Eye's public domain collection
2. Converted SVGs to high-resolution PNG format (maintaining vector quality)
3. Renamed files to match game naming convention (`card_suits_rank` format)
4. Optimized for Phaser 3 loading with proper texture sizing

**Card Features:**

- **Vector-sourced quality**: Sharp at all display sizes
- **Consistent styling**: Professional appearance across all 52 cards + jokers
- **Public domain**: No licensing restrictions
- **Optimized performance**: Pre-converted to PNG for efficient game loading

The Tek Eye card collection ensures professional visual quality while maintaining excellent performance in the Phaser 3 game engine.
