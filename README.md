# Setback Card Game

A multiplayer Setback card game built with **Phaser 3**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**. This project implements the traditional 4-player partnership card game with modern web technologies, comprehensive testing, and AI opponents.

## üéÆ About Setback

Setback is a classic American trick-taking card game played with partnerships. Players bid on how many points they can score, with trump suits determined during play. The game features complex scoring with six categories: High, Low, Jack, Off-Jack, Joker, and Game points.

**Key Features:**

- 4-player partnership gameplay (North/South vs East/West)
- Bidding system with 2-6 point bids
- Dynamic trump suit determination
- Complex scoring with 6 categories
- AI opponents with strategic decision-making
- Modern web interface with responsive design

## üé® Assets & Credits

### Card Sprites

High-quality playing card graphics are sourced from **[Tek Eye](https://tekeye.uk/playing_cards/svg-playing-cards)** - a collection of public domain SVG playing cards. These vector-based cards provide crisp, scalable graphics perfect for web games.

**Setup Process:**

1. Downloaded SVG card files from Tek Eye's public domain collection
2. Converted SVGs to high-resolution PNG format (maintaining vector quality)
3. Renamed files to match game naming convention (`card_suits_rank` format)
4. Optimized for Phaser 3 loading with proper texture sizing

**Card Features:**

- **Vector-sourced quality**: Sharp at all display sizes
- **Consistent styling**: Professional appearance across all 52 cards + jokers
- **Public domain**: No licensing restrictions
- **Optimized performance**: Pre-converted to PNG for efficient game loading

The Tek Eye card collection ensures professional visual quality while maintaining excellent performance in the Phaser 3 game engine.
