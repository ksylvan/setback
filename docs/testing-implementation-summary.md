## Quality Standards Established

### Coverage Requirements

- **80% Line Coverage** minimum for all new code
- **80% Branch Coverage** for decision logic
- **80% Function Coverage** for all methods
- **80% Statement Coverage** for code execution

### Performance Benchmarks

- **Trick Evaluation**: < 10ms per trick
- **Hand Scoring**: < 50ms per hand
- **Test Suite Execution**: < 30 seconds complete run
- **Build Performance**: 60fps maintained during gameplay

### Automation Standards

- **Continuous Integration**: Full test suite in CI/CD pipeline
- **Coverage Enforcement**: Build fails if thresholds not met
- **TypeScript Validation**: Zero compilation errors required

## Development Workflow Integration

### Commands Available

```bash
npm run test              # Interactive watch mode
npm run test:ui          # Visual test interface
npm run test:run         # Single CI run
npm run test:coverage    # Coverage reporting
npm run test:watch       # Continuous testing
```
