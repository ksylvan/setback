## 🔧 Integration Points

### GameManager Integration

#### Required Modifications to GameManager.ts
```typescript
// Add AI import
import { BiddingAI } from '@/ai/BiddingAI';

class GameManager extends EventEmitter {
  private biddingAI: BiddingAI;
  
  constructor(config: GameConfig) {
    // Initialize AI system
    this.biddingAI = new BiddingAI();
  }
  
  // Modify bidding phase to call AI
  private async handleAIBidding(player: Player): Promise<void> {
    const bid = await this.biddingAI.calculateBid(
      player.hand, 
      this.gameState
    );
    
    if (bid !== null) {
      this.placeBid(player.id, bid);
    } else {
      this.passBid(player.id);
    }
  }
}
```

#### Event Integration
- AI decisions trigger existing bid events
- No changes needed to GameScene event handlers
- UI automatically updates through existing event system

### Type System Updates

#### New Interfaces to Add to game.ts
```typescript
// AI-specific types
interface HandEvaluation {
  trumpStrength: Map<Suit, number>;
  pointCards: number;
  specialCards: {
    joker: boolean;
    jacks: Suit[];
  };
  trickPotential: Map<Suit, number>;
  overallStrength: number;
}

interface AIBiddingProfile {
  personality: AIPersonality;
  riskTolerance: number;
  aggressionLevel: number;
  partnershipWeight: number;
}

enum AIPersonality {
  CONSERVATIVE = "conservative",
  BALANCED = "balanced", 
  AGGRESSIVE = "aggressive",
  ADAPTIVE = "adaptive"
}
```

## ⚡ Performance Targets

### Response Time Requirements
- **Hand Evaluation**: < 100ms per evaluation
- **Bidding Decision**: < 500ms total decision time
- **Memory Usage**: < 50MB additional for AI system
- **CPU Impact**: < 10% additional CPU during AI turns

### Optimization Strategies
- Cache hand evaluations during bidding round
- Precompute trump strength tables
- Use efficient data structures for card analysis
- Lazy evaluation of complex calculations

### Performance Monitoring
```typescript
// Add performance tracking
class BiddingAI {
  private performanceStats = {
    evaluationTime: 0,
    decisionTime: 0,
    calls: 0
  };
  
  calculateBid(hand: Card[], gameState: GameState): number | null {
    const startTime = performance.now();
    // ... bidding logic
    const endTime = performance.now();
    this.updatePerformanceStats(endTime - startTime);
  }
}
```
