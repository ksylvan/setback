# Story: SB-006 Enhanced Card Interactions

**Epic:** User Interface
**Story ID:** SB-006
**Priority:** High
**Points:** 8
**Status:** In Progress - Desktop Complete, Mobile Pending

## Description

Implement comprehensive card interaction enhancements to provide intuitive, responsive, and accessible card controls that clearly communicate card playability and game state to players. This story enhances the existing CardSprite and GameScene card interaction system with advanced visual feedback, detailed tooltips, confirm-to-play interaction patterns, keyboard navigation, and comprehensive accessibility support.

The implementation builds upon the current basic card selection system to create a professional-grade user interface that follows modern game UX patterns while maintaining optimal performance for the Setback card game.

## Game Design Context

**GDD Reference:** User Interface Requirements - Interactive Elements (Section 8.2)

**Game Mechanic:** Card Selection and Playing Interface

**Player Experience Goal:** Provide intuitive, responsive card interactions that enhance strategic gameplay by clearly communicating game state and available options without overwhelming the player

**Balance Parameters:**

- Visual feedback response time: < 50ms for immediate responsiveness
- Tooltip display delay: 300ms hover delay for intentional information seeking
- Animation duration: 150ms for smooth but not distracting transitions
- Card playability checking: Real-time validation with immediate visual feedback

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

**Test Files:**

- `tests/components/CardTooltip.test.ts`
- `tests/components/CardSprite.test.ts`
- `tests/managers/KeyboardManager.test.ts`
- `tests/utils/InteractionUtils.test.ts`

**Test Scenarios:**

- CardTooltip shows correct information for playable and unplayable cards
- CardSprite visual states update correctly based on game state changes
- KeyboardManager handles navigation and selection events properly
- Touch interaction handling works correctly on mobile devices
- Performance testing for tooltip creation and animation systems
- Edge case handling for rapid interaction state changes

### Game Testing

**Manual Test Cases:**

1. **Card Playability Visual Feedback**

   - Expected: Playable cards show green border, unplayable cards are dimmed with red tint
   - Performance: Visual updates occur within 50ms of game state changes

2. **Tooltip Information Display**
   - Expected: Hover shows comprehensive card info and playability reasoning
   - Edge Case: Tooltips handle screen edge positioning and multiple rapid hovers

3. **Keyboard Navigation Flow**
   - Expected: Full game control via keyboard with clear focus indicators
   - Performance: Navigation responds immediately with smooth focus transitions

4. **Confirm-to-Play Interaction**
   - Expected: Click selects card, requires confirmation action to play
   - Edge Case: Handles rapid clicking and accidental selections gracefully

### Performance Tests

**Metrics to Verify:**

- Frame rate maintains 60 FPS during tooltip animations and card state changes
- Memory usage stays under 75MB with extensive tooltip usage
- Touch response time < 100ms on mobile devices
- Keyboard navigation latency < 50ms
- Animation performance maintains smooth 60fps during simultaneous card interactions

## Dependencies

## Notes

**Implementation Notes:**

- Use Phaser's object pooling for tooltips to prevent memory allocation during gameplay
- Implement efficient event delegation to minimize performance impact of interaction handlers
- Consider using CSS-in-JS for complex tooltip styling while maintaining Phaser integration
- Mobile touch events should use passive listeners where possible for scroll performance

**Design Decisions:**

- Confirm-to-play pattern: Prevents accidental card plays while maintaining game flow speed
- Visual hierarchy: Green/red color coding follows universal accessibility standards
- Keyboard navigation: Follows web accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1) for inclusive design
- Tooltip positioning: Dynamic placement ensures visibility across all screen sizes

**Future Considerations:**

- Advanced tooltips with card probability calculations and strategic hints
- Customizable interaction preferences for different player skill levels
- Voice control integration for enhanced accessibility
- Haptic feedback for supported mobile devices
