## Current Implementation Status

Based on the existing codebase analysis:

### âœ… Already Complete

- Project scaffolding (Phaser 3 + TypeScript + Vite)
- Basic game architecture (GameManager, Card/Deck entities)
- Game state management and event system
- Basic bidding system implementation
- Player and partnership structures

### ðŸ”„ Ready to Implement (Phase 1a)

- **SB-001**: Card playing mechanics (extends existing GameManager)
- **SB-002**: Trick-taking logic (builds on Card comparison methods)
- **SB-003**: Hand completion flow (integrates with existing game phases)

### ðŸ“‹ Next Priority (Phase 1b)

- **SB-004**: Scoring system (most complex story, 8 points)
- **SB-005**: Game completion (finalizes core gameplay loop)

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
