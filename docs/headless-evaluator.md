# Headless AI Evaluation Tournament System - PRD

**Epic:** AI Intelligence Testing & Analytics

**Story ID:** EVAL-001

**Priority:** High

**Points:** 13

**Status:** Draft

## Description

Implement a comprehensive headless tournament system to evaluate the AI bidding strategy through automated gameplay simulation. This system will run 1000+ games without UI rendering to generate statistical data on AI performance, personality differentiation, and strategic effectiveness. The system provides quantitative validation of AI behavior patterns and enables data-driven optimization of the bidding algorithms.

This PRD establishes the foundation for measuring AI quality, ensuring balanced gameplay experiences, and providing metrics-driven development feedback for continuous AI improvement.
